# Banking System demonstration

It is just a minimalist Banking System demonstration made using Qt framework for C++, Pardon for the bugs and poor security for data base :)
  - C++
  - QT Libs available with *QT basic installation*
  - CSV *(Poor, but an encrypted version of this database is used)*

## Configuration of your system for Editing and Build

  - Install QT on your system with compilers of your choice
    >Reference : https://youtu.be/eS7ank-qFjg
    >Download from : https://www.qt.io/download
  - Suggested compiler to build : Desktop Qt 5.0+ MinGW 64-bit
  - Editor Suggested : QT creator

Banking System is basically a mini project by me, [Omkar Phansopkar](http://omkarph.rf.gd) for subject project and It is not with the best security available but it works, so *Security* is the biggest thing you can improve and contribute to if interested, since am not working on it anymore. 


### Wanna just try out and explore output for already built project, with no need of any configuration (Compiled for windows only)

Open the [Final_Release folder](https://github.com/OmkarPh/BankingSystem/Final_Release) in Repo and run .exe file directly on your windows PC.
