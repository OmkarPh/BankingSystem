# Banking System demonstration

It is just a minimalist Banking System demonstration made using Qt framework for C++, Pardon for the bugs and poor security for data base :)
  - C++
  - QT Libs available with *QT basic installation.*
  - CSV *(Poor, but an encrypted version of this database is used.)*

## Configuration of your system for Editing and Build

  - Install QT on your system with compilers of your choice

Banking System is basically a mini project by me, [Omkar Phansopkar](http://omkarph.rf.gd) for subject project and It is not with the best security available but it works, so *Security* is the biggest thing you can improve and contribute to if interested, since am not working on the project anymore.
